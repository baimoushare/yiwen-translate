/// <summary>
/// The continuous half of realtime translation: watches each region on its own loop and pays for
/// recognition and translation only when what it is watching has actually changed.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This is a monitoring loop that may run for hours next to a game, so every stage exists to avoid
/// work rather than to do it:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>a poll grabs a small rectangle and summarises it — an idle region costs only that;</item>
/// <item><see cref="RealtimeRegionState"/> decides when a changed frame is worth reading, so text
/// that is fading in or scrolling is recognised once rather than at every intermediate frame,
/// without ever waiting forever for a still frame that moving content will never produce;</item>
/// <item>recognised text that says the same thing as what is already on screen ends the pass without
/// a network call — see <see cref="TextSimilarity"/>, which is what keeps recognition's own jitter
/// from being mistaken for the words having changed;</item>
/// <item>a per-session cache means a line of dialogue that comes back (a repeated subtitle, a menu
/// the user reopens) is never translated twice.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// Each region runs on its own loop, no loop ever queues for the recogniser — a busy engine means
/// this poll is skipped, not that this region waits — and no loop waits for a translation it asked
/// for (see <see cref="RegionTranslationPump"/>). All three follow from what "realtime" costs when
/// it is not true: a shared loop makes every region wait out the slowest one, a queued pass answers
/// a frame that has already been replaced while delaying the frame that replaced it, and a loop
/// waiting on the network is a loop not watching the screen. The screenshot flow makes the opposite
/// trade, because its user is waiting for that one result and it will not come round again.
///
/// The OCR and translation services are handed in rather than created: they are the same instances
/// the screenshot flow uses, so the two features share one loaded ONNX runtime and one bounded pool
/// of inference slots instead of competing for the CPU with a second copy of each.
