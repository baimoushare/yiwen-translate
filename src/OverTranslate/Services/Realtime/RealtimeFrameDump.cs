/// Writes out the frames that tell us something about how a realtime pass read, when asked to.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// "Recognition found nothing" has causes that the log cannot separate however much is written to
/// it: the line may be framed outside the watched block, clipped by its edge, too small or too faint
/// for the detector, or the grab may have caught the player mid-repaint. All of them look identical
/// from the outside — an empty result — and all of them are obvious in one glance at the frame.
///
/// Two kinds are kept, and they answer different questions. <see cref="SaveUnread"/> holds the
/// frames every size gave up on; a session of those was what showed the reading problem was mostly
/// not one — thirty of thirty-three held no subtitle at all, and the cost was the fallback sweep
/// running over blank picture. <see cref="SaveFallbackRescue"/> holds the frames the first size read
/// nothing in and a later one read fine, which is the only sample that can say whether the detector
/// really is fussy about scale. The second kind is rare where the first is common — five against
/// thirty-three in that same session — so they are counted separately. Sharing one allowance would
/// let the common kind spend it all and leave none for the kind actually being asked about.
///
/// Off unless the marker file exists, and deliberately so: these are pictures of whatever the user
/// has on screen. A file rather than an environment variable because the application is normally
/// started from a shortcut or a debugger, neither of which inherits a variable typed into a shell —
/// creating a file next to the log is something anyone can do, and deleting it turns this off again.
/// Each kind is kept to <see cref="MaxFrames"/> per run so leaving it on cannot quietly fill a disk.
