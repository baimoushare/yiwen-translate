/// <remarks>
/// Small source text needs proportionally more size than large text: at 12px the translated CJK
/// glyphs are far denser than the Latin original they replace, so matching the source height 1:1
/// renders them unreadable, while at 20px the same boost would look oversized. The ratios below
/// encode that, and they are the ones this overlay has always used.
///
/// What changed is how a block picks between them. This used to be a hard switch at
/// <c>height &lt;= 14</c> — under it, ×1.18 with a 14.5 floor (plus a further ×1.08 for Latin
/// sources rendered as CJK); over it, ×1.06 with a 13 floor. Two blocks a fraction of a pixel
/// apart therefore rendered ~18% apart, and OCR box heights are not stable to a fraction of a
/// pixel: measured heights for ordinary UI text cluster at 12–16, right on the boundary, and any
/// change to how the detector is fed moves them by ~0.5px. That is enough to tip a block across
/// and visibly resize its text without the underlying capture having changed at all.
///
/// Interpolating across a 12–16 band instead keeps both endpoints exactly as before — a 12px block
/// still gets the full small-text treatment, a 16px block still gets none — but makes everything
/// between them continuous, so a 0.5px shift in the measured height moves the font by ~0.5px
/// rather than by a fifth of its size.
