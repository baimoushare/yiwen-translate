/// The page holds two kinds of value, and the line between them is the rule to keep:
///
/// <para><b>Parameters of one sitting</b> — capture source, screen and block count — are not read
/// from or written to the settings file. Reopening the window must not restore a screen that may
/// have been unplugged, or blocks that no longer frame the same content. The capture source is the
/// clearest case of the rule: 視窗擷取 is a live window handle, which does not survive the window
/// being closed, let alone the next launch, so storing the mode alone would reopen the page in a
/// state missing its own answer.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Translation preferences</b> — both languages and the service — are stored independently
/// from screenshot and text translation. Watching a game and translating a document are different
/// jobs with different latency and quality requirements, but choosing the same realtime pair and
/// service on every launch is needless repetition. The source language joined them late, and it is
/// the one with a cost: someone who watched Japanese yesterday and English today starts on the wrong
/// one, and realtime recognition gives no sign of a mismatch beyond reading badly. It is offered
/// back anyway because it is a language the user picked, not one guessed for them — 自動 is not in
/// this page's picker at all — and re-picking it every sitting is the repetition this group exists
/// to remove.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Appearance preferences</b> — the subtitle's two colours and how opaque its band is, in
/// 顯示外觀 — are stored and restored. A reader who needs yellow on dark blue needs it every session,
/// and re-picking it each time is the same failure as forgetting a theme. They live here rather than
/// in 設定 so the control sits beside what it changes.</para>
///
/// <para>Nothing on screen currently marks which card is which; 翻譯區塊 states that its value is not
/// kept, and 顯示外觀 says nothing either way. That is a deliberate trade for a shorter card, not an
/// oversight — if it turns out to confuse anyone, the fix is a line in 顯示外觀 saying its values are
/// kept, not removing the note from 翻譯區塊.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Kept for as long as this window is open</b> — the blocks the user drew, with the mode
/// chosen for each. Not a preference and not a parameter: it is the answer to "where is the text",
/// which is worth several minutes of dragging and is thrown away the moment the question changes.
/// It lives in <see cref="RealtimeSessionController"/> rather than here, and this page tells it to
/// forget in the two cases that change the question — the block count moving, and this window
/// closing.</para>
///
